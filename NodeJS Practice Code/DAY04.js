// Question 1: Difference Between MongoDB Server & Node.js Server
// Explain the difference between a MongoDB server and a Node.js server in terms of their roles and
// functionalities. Provide examples of situations where you would use each server type.

// solution
// The MongoDB server is responsible for storing and managing data in the MongoDB Database. It
// handles data storage, retrieval, and manipulation operations. On the other hand, a Node.js server is a runtime
// environment that executes JavaScript code. It handles incoming requests from clients, processes them, and
// can interact with databases like MongoDB to retrieve or update data. You would use a MongoDB server to
// store and manage data, while Node.js server is used to handle application logic and server client requests.

// Question 2: MongoDB Queries
// a) Write a MongoDB query to create a new document in a collection named "students" with fields "name,"
// "age," and "grade."
// b) Write a MongoDB query to update the "age" field of a document in the "employees" collection with the name
// "John" to 30.
// c) Write a MongoDB query to delete a document from the "products" collection with the name "Product A."
// d) Write a MongoDB query to retrieve all documents from the "orders" collection where the total amount is
// greater than $100.

// solution
// a) db.students.insertOne({name: "Rohit", age: 23, grade: "A"})
// b) db.employees.updateOne({name: "John"}, {$set: {age: 30}})
// c) db.products.deleteOne({name: "Product A"})
// d) db.orders.find({totalAmount: {$gt: 100}})

// Question 3: SQL vs. MongoDB
// Explain the main differences between SQL databases and MongoDB in terms of data structure, querying
// language, and use cases. Provide examples of scenarios where you might choose one over the other.

// solution
// SQL databases use structured tables with rows and columns to store data, while MongoDB uses
// flexible and dynamic documents in collections. SQL databases use SQL as a querying language, while
// MongoDB uses a JavaScript-like syntax for queries. SQL databases are suitable for applications with
// well-defined and structured data, such as financial systems. MongoDB is better for projects with changing or
// unstructured data, like content management systems to real-time analytics.

// Question 4: Query Comparison
// Compare and contrast the following MongoDB and SQL queries for retrieving data:
// a) MongoDB: db.products.find({ category: "Electronics" })
// SQL: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = "Electronics"
// b) MongoDB: db.users.findOne({ username: "Alice" })
// SQL: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = "Alice"
// c) MongoDB: db.orders.aggregate([{ $group: { _id: "$status", total: { $sum:
// "$amount" } } }])
// SQL: SELECT status, SUM(amount) as total FROM orders GROUP BY status

// solution
// a) Both queries retrieve products with the category "Electronics."
// b) Both queries retrieve a user named "Alice."
// c) Both queries calculate the total amount of orders grouped by status.
